## 1. Introduction

To put you in the context, ALGOSUP is a school where all our classes are in English, but the students still talk in French during their project time.  

The aim of this project is to listen conversations during project time and detect when they talk in English or French. The students will not interact with the device.

This will be a device to make sure that the students talk in English during project time.  A colour will be emitted following the language spoken (green for good English, red for French, and blue for other language)

### Team

The team will be composed of:
Clémentine CUREL as Project Manager
Louis DE LAVENNE DE CHOULOT DE CHABAUD-LA-TOUR as Tech Leader
Max BERNARD
Léo CHARTIER
Thomas PLANCHARD
Quentin CLEMENT

## 2. Definitions of terms

|  Terms| Definition  |
|--|--|
| Machine learning| Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which is broadly defined as the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behaviour. Artificial intelligence systems are used to perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans solve problems. Machine learning is one way to use AI. |
|AI| Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer or a robot controlled by a computer to do tasks that are usually done by humans because they require human intelligence and discernment. |
|Deep learning| Deep Learning, is the concept of computers simulating the process a human brain takes to analyse, think and learn. The deep learning process involves something called a neural network as a part of the thinking process for an AI. It takes an enormous amount of data to train deep learning and a considerably powerful computing device for such computation methods.|
|Hardware| The physical and electronic parts of a computer or other piece of equipment, rather than its software.|

## 3. In-depth

Some more explanations on the project :

- We want to detect french and english whatever the level of the user
- The colour shall change depending on the language the degree of  mastery of the user.

## 4. Data collection

To train an AI, we need a lot of data. The data need to come from a reputable source. It also needs to be labeled.
To consider as much variation as possible, we also need different accents.

## 5. Privacy and confidentiality

We think that it is not necessary to record and keep the records in a cloud to detect a language. Thanks to this we will not need to store the live conversation, the device will detect the language and delete the record after it. We may possibly encrypt some information to ensure security and confidentiality. We don’t want to connect it to the internet to save the data. It will also make the device difficult to hack because to hack it we will need to have a physics contact with the device.

## 6. Use cases

This device can have multiple use cases.

First of all, it may be used to automatically select the origin language on an automatic translator.

Secondly, it could be used worldwide in middle school to reprimendate the students that speak in their native language in the back of the class during English lessons without disturbing the teacher or the rest of the class.
An example would be, at ALGOSUP, an all-English French school of computer science, if a student were to speak French during project time, the police would be alerted and would take them into custody.
