# Functional Specification

## 5. Privacy and confidentiality

We think that it is not necessary to record and keep the records in a cloud to detect a language. Thanks to this we will not need to store the live conversation, the device will detect the language and delete the record after it. We may possibly encrypt some information to ensure security and confidentiality. We donâ€™t want to connect it to the internet to save the data. It will also make the device difficult to hack because to hack it we will need to have a physics contact with the device.
