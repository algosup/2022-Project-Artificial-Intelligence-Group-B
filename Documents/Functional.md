## 1. Introduction

## 2. Definitions of terms

## 3. In-depth

## 4. Data collection

## 5. Privacy and confidentiality

We think that it is not necessary to record and keep the records in a cloud to detect a language. Thanks to this we will not need to store the live conversation, the device will detect the language and delete the record after it. We may possibly encrypt some information to ensure security and confidentiality. We donâ€™t want to connect it to the internet to save the data. It will also make the device difficult to hack because to hack it we will need to have a physics contact with the device.

## 6. Use cases

This device can have multiple use cases.

First of all, it may be used to automatically select the origin language on an automatic translator.

Secondly, it could be used worldwide in middle school to reprimendate the students that speak in their native language in the back of the class during English lessons without disturbing the teacher or the rest of the class.
An example would be, at ALGOSUP, an all-English French school of computer science, if a student were to speak French during project time, the police would be alerted and would take them into custody.
